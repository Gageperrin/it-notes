# AWS Certified DevOps Professional

These are my notes for the AWS DevOps exam. I have taken the content from [Stephane Maarek's course](www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-devops-engineer-professional-hands-on) for this exam, Tutorial Dojo's practice tests, and the official AWS documentation. 

These notes assume full and prior knowledge of requisite material for the Solutions Architect Associate and Professional exams and will not mention or cover any topics that are featured in those exams. Consequently, only a few topics will be treated here.
