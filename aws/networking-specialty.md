# AWS Certified Advanced Networking Specialty

These are my notes for the AWS ANS-C00 exam. I have taken the content from [Adrian Cantrill's course](https://learn.cantrill.io/p/aws-certified-advanced-networking-specialty) for this exam, Tutorial Dojo's practice tests, and the official AWS documentation. 

These notes assume full and prior knowledge of requisite material for the Solutions Architect Associate and Professional exams and will not mention or cover any topics that are featured in those exams. Consequently, only a few topics will be treated here.

#### Extra - NAT ####
