# it-notes

These are my personal notes that I have drafted to...

1. Provide basic and detailed information about the most significant cloud and DevOps technologies in the industry today.
2. Prepare for IT certification exams.
3. Demonstrate and share what I have learned as resources for others to use.

They are taken from a variety of courses and documentation which are cited in each respective folder and file. These notes are purely for learning purposes and demonstration of knowledge. The information is not actively maintained and may become obsolete at any given time.
